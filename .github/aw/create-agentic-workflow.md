## Modes

### Interactive mode

Start with exactly:

> What do you want to automate today?

Then follow a progressive interview — ask one question at a time, advance only when the current phase is clear:

1. **Goal** — confirm workflow name (kebab-case), brief description, optional emoji.
2. **Repository survey for maintenance workflows** — before choosing a portfolio or cadence, inspect the target repository using [maintainer.md](maintainer.md). Infer project type, contribution and validation rules, repository layout, recent activity, issue and pull request state, labels, releases, and CI health. Summarize the observed signals and derive an initial low-risk strategy; ask only for policy or capacity information that cannot be inferred.
3. **Trigger** — ask "When should this run?" and map to an `on:` block (see trigger mapping in [designer-mappings.md](designer-mappings.md)).
4. **Scope** — ask what it reads and what it creates or updates; map to `permissions:`, `tools:`, and `safe-outputs:`.
5. **Data strategy** — ask whether GitHub data should be pre-fetched with `gh` + `jq` (DataOps default); map to `steps:`.
6. **Guardrails** — ask whether it should block, advise, or silently log; guide toward `noop` and safe-output behavior.
7. **Context & network** — ask about external APIs, MCP servers, and required secrets; map to `network.allowed` and `env:`.
8. **Engine** (skip if obvious) — if ambiguous, suggest Copilot as the default.
9. **Confirmation** — present a structured summary before generating:

   ```text
   Proposed workflow:
   - Name: <workflow-id>
   - Trigger: <event + key options>
   - Engine: <engine or default>
   - Tools: <tool summary>
   - Safe outputs: <list or none>
   - Network: <allowed summary>
   - Integrations/Auth: <service/mcp + required secrets/env vars>
   - Repository signals: <maintenance workflows only>
   - Initial maintenance portfolio: <maintenance workflows only>
   - Intent: <one-sentence task>
   ```

   Ask: **"Ready to generate, or want to adjust anything?"**

Skip phases when the answer is already clear from earlier statements. Apply progressive disclosure: at most 5 questions before presenting the confirmation summary; then ask "anything else?" if needed. Detect done signals (`that's it`, `looks good`, `generate it`) and proceed to generation.

For detailed trigger/safe-output/network/tool decision heuristics and integration auth setup patterns, load [designer-mappings.md](designer-mappings.md). For token-optimization defaults, load [designer.md](designer.md).

### Issue-form mode

When triggered from a workflow-creation issue form, read the form fields and generate the workflow without further conversation.

## Conversation Rules

- Keep the conversation short and iterative.
- Translate user intent into workflow structure.
- When the user asks for exploration, evaluation, or scenario design rather than file creation, stay in ad hoc evaluation mode.
- In ad hoc evaluation mode, do not create `.github/workflows/*.md`.
- Do not overwhelm the user with long option dumps unless they ask.
- If the request exceeds the single-job model, explain the constraint and recommend traditional GitHub Actions.

## Ad Hoc Evaluation Mode

Use this mode for exploratory testing, persona walkthroughs, and "what workflow would you create for this scenario?" requests.

- Do not create or edit workflow files.
- Return a compact recommendation covering trigger, any scoped `paths:` filters for file-event triggers, read tools, safe outputs, permissions, and explicit `noop` criteria.
- For recurring reports or digests, always include the report window, grouping dimensions, and deduplication key. See [triggers.md](triggers.md) for key-format examples.
- Exit ad hoc evaluation mode only when the user explicitly asks to create, implement, or write the workflow file.
- End by offering to turn the recommendation into `.github/workflows/<workflow-id>.md` if the user wants to proceed.

### Invocation Surface

Ad hoc evaluation is reached by addressing the `agentic-workflows` custom agent directly in conversation (chat prompt, issue comment, or PR comment) — it is **not** a CLI flag or MCP tool parameter. The `gh aw` CLI and MCP tools (`compile`, `audit`, `status`, `update`, etc.) only manage existing workflow files and do not accept a `prompt`/`scenario`/`query` parameter; passing one will fail with an "Unknown parameter" error. Use the example prompt below instead of trying to script evaluation through a tool call.

### Single-Scenario Evaluation Example

> agentic-workflows evaluate this scenario without creating files: Information Worker — weekly summary of stale documentation files not updated in the last 90 days

Return a single recommendation table using the same fields as the multi-scenario example below (trigger, scope, read tools, safe outputs, permissions, noop condition). Only create `.github/workflows/<workflow-id>.md` if the user then explicitly asks to proceed.

### Multi-Scenario Evaluation Example

To compare multiple persona or task slices in a single request, use the following prompt format:

> agentic-workflows evaluate these scenarios without creating files:
> 1. Information Worker — weekly digest of open issues and PRs assigned to me
> 2. Product Manager — recurring backlog triage report sorted by staleness
> 3. Backend Engineer — API contract diff review on every pull request

For each scenario, return a compact recommendation table covering:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Trigger | event + key options |
| Scope | paths filter or scheduling window |
| Read tools | gh-proxy toolsets or optional tools |
| Safe outputs | add-comment / create-issue / noop |
| Permissions | read-only scopes required |
| Noop condition | when no action is needed |

### Failure Classification

When evaluating scenarios, classify any failure before stopping:

| Failure type | Symptom | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Transient issue | Network error, timeout, or quota exceeded | Retry once; if it persists, record `invocation_unavailable` and continue with partial results |
| Unsupported command | Unknown subcommand or unrecognized option | Record `command_not_supported`, document the gap, and fall back to providing the recommendation directly from local gh-aw guidance |
| Product gap | Invocation succeeds but returns no workflow-design guidance | Record `response_unavailable`, note the scenario, and surface it as a missing capability rather than treating it as an error |

## Design Checklist

### 1. Pick the workflow ID

- Derive kebab-case from the workflow name.
- Before creating the file, check whether `.github/workflows/<workflow-id>.md` already exists.
- If it exists, choose a more specific ID instead of overwriting.

### 2. Choose the trigger

Use the smallest trigger that matches the request.

Common mappings:

- issue automation → `on: issues:`
- pull request automation → `on: pull_request:`
- scheduled reporting → fuzzy `schedule:` such as `daily on weekdays`
- on-demand comments → `slash_command`
- UI-driven actions → `label_command`
- GitHub Actions pipeline monitoring → `workflow_run`
- external deployment monitoring → `deployment_status`

| Scenario | Trigger and default output | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Recurring reports and stakeholder digests | `schedule` (+ `workflow_dispatch` for reruns), usually `create-issue` | [Reporting/digest guidance](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#reporting-and-digest-guidance) |
| Persona-oriented requests (PM, design governance, compliance policy) | `pull_request` with scoped `paths:` when the request is framed around changed files (`tokens/**`, `**/*tokens*.json`, `**/theme/**`, `policy/**`, `compliance/**`, `controls/**`, `docs/policies/**`); `schedule` (+ `workflow_dispatch`) for recurring audits | [Persona scenario map](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#persona-oriented-scenario-map) |
| Backend schema/API review | `pull_request` with backend contract `paths:` and `add-comment` | [Backend review guidance](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#backend-review-guidance) |
| PR analyzers deciding comment vs issue vs noop | `pull_request` + escalation logic | [PR analyzer escalation](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#pr-analyzer-escalation-guidance) |
| Incident workflows | `workflow_run` / `deployment_status` with `create-issue` dedup | [Incident dedup-key templates](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#incident-dedup-key-templates-workflow_run-and-deployment_status) |
| Dependency-license and policy compliance | `pull_request` with manifest `paths:` | [Compliance review guidance](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#compliance-review-guidance) |
| Coverage analysis | `pull_request` or CI-linked triggers with explicit fallback | [Coverage-analysis guidance](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#coverage-analysis-guidance) |

Use [triggers.md](triggers.md), [workflow-patterns.md](workflow-patterns.md), and [create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md) for detailed trigger-selection patterns.

### 3. Keep permissions read-only

See [workflow-constraints.md](workflow-constraints.md) for the read-only security posture. Specific to workflow creation:

- Do not grant `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`, or `contents: write` to the agent job.
- When targeting the Copilot coding agent, recommend `permissions: { copilot-requests: write }` so Copilot can authenticate with `${{ github.token }}`.
- If the user asks for direct writes, explain why the safe-output pattern is required.

### 4. Select tools

- `bash` and `edit` are enabled by default in sandboxed workflows; do not add them unless you are restricting them.
- For GitHub reads, prefer `tools.github.mode: gh-proxy` and instruct the agent to use `gh` commands.
- For non-GitHub MCP servers, prefer `tools.cli-proxy: true` and instruct the agent to use the mounted `mcp-clis` commands.
- Combined configuration example for GitHub reads plus non-GitHub MCP CLI access:

  ```yaml
  tools:
    github:
      mode: gh-proxy
      toolsets: [default]
    cli-proxy: true
  ```

  Omit `cli-proxy: true` when the workflow only needs GitHub reads.

- Suggest `playwright` for browser automation.
- Suggest dedicated topic files rather than embedding long tutorials in the prompt.

### 5. Infer network access from repository files

Do not ask for the ecosystem if it can be inferred from the repository.

Common mappings:

- `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `*.sln`, `*.slnx`, `global.json` → `dotnet`
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `uv.lock` → `python`
- `package.json`, `.nvmrc`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `node`
- `go.mod`, `go.sum` → `go`
- `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` → `java`
- `Gemfile`, `*.gemspec` → `ruby`
- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` → `rust`
- `Package.swift`, `*.podspec` → `swift`
- `composer.json` → `php`
- `pubspec.yaml` → `dart`

Never use `network: defaults` alone for workflows that build, test, or install packages.

### 6. Configure safe outputs

Map write behavior to `safe-outputs:`.

Common mappings:

- create issues → `create-issue`
- add comments → `add-comment`
- create PRs → `create-pull-request`
- add labels → `add-labels`
- attach downloadable files → `upload-artifact`
- publish embeddable assets → `upload-asset`

Rules:

- always restrict `create-pull-request.allowed-files`
- prefer the dedicated safe output instead of shelling out to `gh` for the same mutation
- include `noop` guidance in the prompt so successful no-op runs are explicit
- when using `create-issue`, instruct the agent to provide a meaningful body (20-65000 characters; avoid placeholder-only text)

### 7. Decide who can trigger the workflow

- Default behavior is team-only triggering.
- For community-facing issue triage or other public entrypoints, recommend `roles: all`.

### 8. Add cost-aware triage and context flow

- For high-volume inputs, apply the [High-Volume Triage and Escalation Pattern](workflow-patterns.md#high-volume-triage-and-escalation-pattern): cheap triage first, `noop`/safe output for known/duplicate/stale/low-value cases, frontier reasoning reserved for ambiguous/high-value cases, and context pulled on demand.
- Use deterministic `steps:` plus compact files under `/tmp/gh-aw/` when large data must be preprocessed.

See also: [subagents.md](subagents.md) and [token-optimization.md](token-optimization.md).

### 9. Omit unnecessary defaults

Avoid adding fields just to restate defaults.

Usually omit:

- `engine: copilot`
- unrestricted `bash`
- `edit`
- `timeout-minutes:` unless a custom timeout is needed

## Prompt Requirements

The markdown body should:

- state the workflow goal clearly
- reference the triggering context explicitly
- name the allowed safe outputs when write actions are expected
- instruct the agent to call `noop` when no visible change is needed
- stay concise and task-focused

When the workflow generates reports or markdown output, include these formatting rules only when relevant:

- use GitHub-flavored markdown
- start nested report headings at `###`
- use `<details><summary>...</summary>` for long collapsible sections
- format workflow run links as `[§12345](https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/12345)`

## Issue-Form Mode Procedure

When processing a workflow-creation issue form:

1. extract the workflow name, description, and additional context
2. derive a unique workflow ID
3. infer the trigger, tools, network access, and safe outputs
4. create exactly one workflow markdown file
5. compile it with `gh aw compile <workflow-id>`
6. include the generated `.lock.yml` in the PR

## Safe Outputs

- Use the configured safe outputs for visible actions.
- Use `noop` with a short explanation when no action is required.
```

## PR-Report Checklist

Before finalizing any `pull_request`-triggered reporting workflow, verify:

- [ ] **Permissions**: `contents: read` + `pull-requests: read` in the agent job; no write permissions
- [ ] **Safe outputs**: `add-comment` for inline findings; `create-issue` for incidents needing follow-up
- [ ] **Network**: infer ecosystem from repository lock files; never use `defaults` alone when packages are installed
- [ ] **`noop` required**: prompt instructs the agent to call `noop` with a brief explanation when no issues are found

## Generated Workflow Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any newly generated workflow, verify:

- [ ] **Trigger fit**: trigger matches user intent and event granularity (for example `pull_request`, `workflow_run`, `deployment_status`, `schedule`, `slash_command`)
- [ ] **Maintenance baseline**: recurring maintenance strategies are derived from a bounded repository survey, with observed signals separated from recommendations
- [ ] **Tool fit**: enabled tools are the minimal set needed for reads/analysis (prefer `gh-proxy`; add `playwright`/`cache-memory` only when required)
- [ ] **Safe outputs**: all visible writes route through `safe-outputs:` and include `noop` for explicit no-op outcomes
- [ ] **Permissions**: agent job remains read-only; no direct write scopes granted
- [ ] **Network**: access is inferred from repository ecosystem and avoids `network: defaults` alone for install/build/test workflows
- [ ] **Prompt clarity**: prompt is concise, context-aware, and clearly states expected outputs and stop/no-op behavior

## Generated Workflow Scoping Checklist

Before finalizing any newly generated workflow, verify:

- [ ] **Paths scope**: include `paths:`/`paths-ignore:` when the automation should ignore unrelated files (for backend reviews, include migration/schema/API contract globs; for design governance, include design-token/theme globs like `tokens/**` and `**/theme/**`; for compliance policy reviews, include policy/control docs like `policy/**`, `compliance/**`, `controls/**`, `docs/policies/**`)
- [ ] **Labels scope**: define required labels (for example `label_command` names or PR/issue label filters) when label-based routing is expected
- [ ] **Workflow-name scope**: for `workflow_run`, explicitly set `workflows:` to named targets and gate conclusions via `if:` on `${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion }}` (for incident triage, prefer failure-only outcomes)
- [ ] **Date-window scope**: for reporting/triage, state the exact window (for example `last 24h`, `since previous run`, `current week`)
- [ ] **Safe-output write contract**: name which safe output is used for each outcome and when `noop` is required instead of a write

## Multi-Repository Requests

For cross-repository workflows, first determine whether the question is **finite and bounded**:

- If the answer requires arbitrary source-code extraction, full file contents, or other unbounded access:
  - enable the GitHub toolsets needed to read external repositories
  - configure cross-repo authentication in `safe-outputs:`
  - tell the agent to set `target-repo`
  - explain that the workflow still cannot wait for external workflows or create multi-job orchestration

Use [workflow-patterns.md](workflow-patterns.md) for the compact cross-repo pattern.

## Final Steps

1. create `.github/workflows/<workflow-id>.md`
2. compile with `gh aw compile <workflow-id>`
3. fix all compile errors
4. create a PR with the workflow file and `.lock.yml`

## Guidelines

- create exactly one workflow `.md` file as the primary deliverable
- keep prompts short, specific, and imperative
- prefer dedicated reference files over repeating large explanations inline
- always compile before finishing
- keep responses concise after the workflow is created
