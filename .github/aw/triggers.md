## Trigger Selection

Use the smallest trigger that matches the request.

### Decision Matrix

| User intent | Trigger | Typical read tools | Typical safe output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Review PR changes, comment on quality, suggest fixes | `pull_request` | `github` (`gh-proxy`), optional `playwright` for UI diffs | `add-comment` |
| Investigate failed CI/Actions runs and summarize incident | `workflow_run` | `github` (`gh-proxy`) with `actions: read` | `create-issue` |
| Monitor external service deployment failures (Heroku, Vercel, Fly.io) | `deployment_status` | `github` (`gh-proxy`) with `deployments: read` | `create-issue` |
| Run visual regression checks on PR UI changes | `pull_request` | `playwright` + `cache-memory` | `add-comment` |
| Publish weekly stakeholder/product digest | `schedule` | `github` (`gh-proxy`) | `create-issue` (default), `create-discussion` only if explicitly requested |
| Review dependency licenses or design-token governance on PRs | `pull_request` with `paths:` | `github` (`gh-proxy`) | `add-comment`; `create-issue` only for blocked/policy-violating findings |
| Govern documentation content (stale pages, broken links, outdated ownership) | `schedule` or `pull_request` with `paths:` | `github` (`gh-proxy`) | `add-comment` on PR; `create-issue` for stale content |
| PM / product health digest (release velocity, open issues by area) | `schedule` | `github` (`gh-proxy`) | `create-issue` with `close-older-issues: true` |
| Compliance or regulatory review | `pull_request` with `paths:` or `schedule` | `github` (`gh-proxy`) | `add-comment` for findings; `create-issue` for violations |

> **`workflow_run` vs `deployment_status`**: Use `workflow_run` when monitoring another GitHub Actions workflow in the same repository. Use `deployment_status` when an external service (Heroku, Vercel, Fly.io) reports deployment results back to GitHub via the Deployments API. See [deployment-status.md](deployment-status.md) for the full pattern.
>
> For `workflow_run`, always scope explicitly: set `workflows:` to named upstream workflow(s), use `types: [completed]`, and gate outcomes with an `if:` guard on `${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion }}` (for incident triage, usually `failure`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, `action_required`) unless the user asked for success reporting.

### Scenario Examples

Engineering-focused:

- **Schema/API review on PRs**: trigger `pull_request` with `paths:` scoped to backend contract files (for example `db/migrate/**`, `migrations/**`, `schema/**`, `openapi/**`, `api/**`), read via `github` (`gh-proxy`), publish findings with `add-comment`, call `noop` when contracts are unchanged.
- **Visual regression on UI changes**: trigger `pull_request`, use only `playwright` + `cache-memory` (no extra tools), keep network minimal (allowlist only target preview/app hosts if required), state the exact baseline source (`cache-memory` key, artifact, or branch path), publish via `add-comment`, call `noop` when UI paths are unchanged.
- **Design-token governance on PRs**:
  - trigger `pull_request` with `paths:` scoped to token sources and theme/config files (for example `tokens/**`, `**/*tokens*.json`, `**/theme/**`, `**/tailwind*.{js,ts}`, `**/*design-token*`)
  - read via `github` (`gh-proxy`) and validate linked token references (style dictionary source, token registry, or design-spec URL) before assessment
  - publish actionable findings with `add-comment`
  - call `noop` when no token files changed, when required references are absent from the in-scope changes, or when no policy/token drift is detected
- **Deployment incident triage**: use `deployment_status` for external provider failures and `workflow_run` for GitHub Actions failures, publish incident reports via `create-issue`, derive a stable failure key (for example workflow + job + failing step or error signature), and call `noop` when a failure self-recovers or matches an existing open incident.
- **Dependency-license compliance review on PRs**: trigger `pull_request` with `paths:` scoped to dependency manifests (for example `package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`), read new dependency additions via `github` (`gh-proxy`), classify each addition by license tier (allowed / needs-review / blocked), publish findings with `add-comment`, escalate blocked additions with `create-issue` for team-wide follow-up, call `noop` when no new dependencies were added or all additions are pre-approved.

Non-engineering personas:

- **Documentation governance**: trigger `schedule` (weekly) or `pull_request` with `paths:` scoped to docs directories, check for stale ownership, broken links, or missing metadata using `github` (`gh-proxy`), publish findings with `create-issue` for pages needing owner action, call `noop` when all docs pass checks.
- **PM / roadmap health digest**:
  - trigger `schedule` (weekly on weekdays)
  - aggregate open issues by label, milestone, or area using `github` (`gh-proxy`)
  - publish a structured summary with `create-issue` and `close-older-issues: true`
  - use an explicit window such as `last 7 full days ending at run start (UTC)`
  - derive a stable key such as `pm-digest:<scope>:2026-W27`
  - call `noop` when the window has zero qualifying updates
- **Product/stakeholder digest**:
  - trigger `schedule` plus optional `workflow_dispatch`
  - define an explicit window such as `last 7 full days ending at run start (UTC)` or `since previous successful run`
  - choose grouping dimensions up front (for example team, service, owner, severity, or status)
  - publish with `create-issue` by default
  - reuse a stable deduplication key for the same scope and window
  - call `noop` when there are no updates in that window
- **Compliance audit (material drift example)**:
  - trigger `schedule: daily on weekdays` as the preferred baseline cadence, and add `workflow_dispatch` for ad hoc reruns
  - define **material drift** as any control-state change that affects compliance posture (for example: required policy file removed, control owner missing, control status downgraded from pass to fail, or required approval evidence link missing)
  - use `github` (`gh-proxy`) to compare current control evidence with the previous successful run window
  - publish violations with `create-issue` using `close-older-issues: true` and a stable key such as `compliance-drift:<framework>:<window-id>`
  - call `noop` when no material drift is detected in the selected window
- **Compliance review (regulatory/policy)**: trigger `schedule` (monthly) or `pull_request` with `paths:` scoped to policy files, read current policy state via `github` (`gh-proxy`), produce a structured compliance report per control or requirement, publish with `create-issue` and `close-older-issues: true`, call `noop` when all controls pass.

### Recurring digest defaults

For PM, stakeholder, and information-worker digests, fix the report window, grouping dimensions, deduplication key, and duplicate-suppression rule up front. See [report.md](report.md) for the canonical defaults.

### Pattern-specific `noop` examples

- **PR reviewer (`pull_request`)**: `noop` when only docs/metadata changed outside scoped `paths:`.
- **Failure triage (`workflow_run`)**: `noop` when rerun succeeds, signal is flake-only, or an open incident already exists for the same failure key.
- **Scheduled digest (`schedule`)**: `noop` when the exact reporting window (for example `since previous successful run`) has zero qualifying updates.
- **Deployment monitor (`deployment_status`)**: `noop` when non-terminal statuses (`queued`, `in_progress`) arrive without a terminal failure.

## Trigger Patterns

### Standard GitHub Events

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
    forks: ["*"]              # Allow from all forks (default: same-repo only)
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1"  # Monday 9AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:    # Manual trigger
```

### `workflow_run` Failure-Triage Pattern

Use this when reacting to failures from another workflow in the same repository:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI", "Deploy"]
    types: [completed]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

Then gate analysis to failure outcomes:

```yaml
if: contains(fromJson('["failure","timed_out","cancelled","action_required"]'), github.event.workflow_run.conclusion)
```

These are "non-success outcomes requiring triage"; keep the list explicit so readers can tighten (e.g., only `failure`) or broaden it.

Escalation rules for this pattern (required):

- Derive a stable failure key before any write (for example `<workflow>:<job>:<step>:<error-signature>`). See [create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md](create-agentic-workflow-trigger-details.md#incident-dedup-key-templates-workflow_run-and-deployment_status) for concrete key-format templates.
- Search for an existing open incident by that key **before** calling `create-issue`.
- `noop` when the monitored run concludes `success`, or when an open incident already exists for the same key (duplicate suppression).

#### Fuzzy Scheduling

Use fuzzy scheduling instead of exact cron to distribute execution times. Avoids load spikes and the "Monday wall of work" from weekend accumulation.

**Basic Fuzzy Schedules:**

```yaml
on:
  schedule: daily on weekdays    # Monday-Friday only (recommended for daily workflows)
  schedule: daily                # All 7 days
  schedule: weekly               # Once per week
  schedule: hourly               # Every hour
```

**Examples with Intervals:**

```yaml
on:
  schedule: every 2 hours on weekdays    # Every 2 hours, Monday-Friday
  schedule: every 6 hours                # Every 6 hours, all days
```

**Why Prefer Weekday Schedules:**

- Avoids Monday backlog from weekend accumulation
- Aligns with team business hours
- Notifications fire when team members are active

The compiler converts fuzzy schedules to deterministic cron (e.g., `daily on weekdays` → `43 5 * * 1-5`), scatters execution to avoid load spikes, and adds `workflow_dispatch:` for manual runs.

**Recommended Pattern:**

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD - Weekday schedule avoids Monday wall of work
on:
  schedule: daily on weekdays

# ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE - But may create Monday backlog
on:
  schedule: daily
```

#### Fork Security for Pull Requests

By default, `pull_request` triggers **block all forks** and only allow PRs from the same repository. Use the `forks:` field to explicitly allow forks:

```yaml
# Default: same-repo PRs only (forks blocked)
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

# Allow all forks
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
    forks: ["*"]

# Allow specific fork patterns
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
    forks: ["trusted-org/*", "trusted-user/repo"]
```

### Command Triggers (/mentions)

```yaml
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot  # Responds to /my-bot in issues/comments
```

This automatically creates conditions to match `/my-bot` mentions in issue bodies and comments.

You can restrict where commands are active using the `events:` field:

```yaml
on:
  slash_command:
    name: my-bot
    events: [issues, issue_comment]  # Only in issue bodies and issue comments
```

**Supported event identifiers:**

- `issues` - Issue bodies (opened, edited, reopened)
- `issue_comment` - Comments on issues only (excludes PR comments)
- `pull_request_comment` - Comments on pull requests only (excludes issue comments)
- `pull_request` - Pull request bodies (opened, edited, reopened)
- `pull_request_review_comment` - Pull request review comments
- `*` - All comment-related events (default)

**Note**: `issue_comment` and `pull_request_comment` both map to GitHub Actions' `issue_comment` event with filtering to distinguish them.

### Label Command Triggers

Trigger workflows when specific labels are added to issues, PRs, or discussions:

```yaml
# Shorthand: trigger on any labeled event
on: label-command my-label

# Or with explicit configuration
on:
  label_command:
    name: ai-review        # Single label name (or use names: [...] for multiple)
    events: [pull_request] # Optional: restrict to issues, pull_request, discussion (default: all three)
    strategy: decentralized # Optional: route labeled events via generated agentic_commands.yml
    remove_label: false    # Optional: remove triggering label after activation (default: true)
```

Use `names:` for multiple labels that activate the same workflow:

```yaml
on:
  label_command:
    names: [ai-review, copilot-review]
    events: [pull_request]
```

By default, the triggering label is automatically removed after the workflow activates (`remove_label: true`). Set `remove_label: false` to keep the label.

The activated label name is exposed to downstream jobs as `${{ needs.activation.outputs.label_command }}`.

### Semi-Active Agent Pattern

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0/10 * * * *"  # Every 10 minutes
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
```
